            This long winter has had me dreaming of beaches for months on end and I know I’m not the only one. I’m excited to 
            be heading back to Asia on holiday soon, so it seemed a perfect time to start lusting over the endless, gorgeous beaches 
            that will be awaiting me when I head back. Sadly I won’t be going to the Philippines this time, but as it has been one of 
            my dream destinations for years. But I’m excited to share this list of seven hidden beaches to explore in the Philippines. 
            If you’re looking for the perfect place to escape the crowds and find an untouched part of the world just for yourself,
             you’ll want to check out these gorgeous sands on your next trip.</p>

            The raw and untouched beauty of the Philippines can be found at hundreds of great beaches spread all over this archipelago nation. 
            Spots like Boracay and Palawan have become legendary as far as the tourist radar is concerned. 
            Popular as they are, they tend to be too crowded. 
            By straying from the beaten track, you could easily explore these beaches above, which are equally beautiful and a lot emptier. 
            These hidden gems may be difficult to access, but they are avenues to an adventure trip like no other – and we all know I love an adventure!.</p>
